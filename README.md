# ThuisGemaakt

Thuisgemaakt is the first ever flutter app I made.
It was initially a project for school but I got interested in it and so I decided to go futher with it.
This is only ui/ux work. There are no api's and/or databases, they are yet to be implemented so stay tuned for updates!

## The app

ThuisGemaakt is essentially a big cookbook for those who like to switch up the recipe's.
Every week, the user receives 7 new recipe's to try out for that week. Those recipe's will not be repeated the weeks after so every week are completely different recipe's. When a recipe is pressed the user gets to see the ingredients, the cook time, prep-time, serving amount and the calories per serving.

I hope this gives a little insight as to what this repository contains.
Thank you for checking it out!
